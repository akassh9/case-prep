# What is a Case Interview?

A case interview is a **30-60 min test** where you're expected to go through a problem solving process.

## The 4 Types of Case Interviews

1. **One on One Case Interview** - Default format - live with an interviewer.
2. **Digital Interview (AI Mock)** - Simulated interview using technology.
3. **Presentation Interview** - Given a bulk of information and asked to go solve it to present findings. Corporate strategy roles usually.
4. **Group Interview** - Simplified version of a case competition. Observed as you co-work. Collaborative problem-solving.

## Case Interview Rounds

- **Round 1** - Rigor & Structure
- **Round 2** - Conversation & Executive Presence

## Top Skills That Firms Look For

1. **Structure** - Organize ideas so that they're easy to follow. Break it down to pieces, but not too much to cause chaos. Be organized.
2. **Problem Solving Ability** - Connect the dots between data, ideas and actions. Hypothesis and Result. Never lose sight that at the end you're looking for a recommendation.
3. **Communication** - Show executive presence & clarity. Enthusiastic, share clearly what you want to do, recap what you're doing.
