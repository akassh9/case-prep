# Interviewer-led vs Interviewee-led Cases

## MBB Spectrum

| Firm | Style |
|------|-------|
| McKinsey | Most Structured |
| Bain | Middle Ground |
| BCG | Most Flexible |

## Interviewer-Led (McKinsey)

Pre-planned process with set order & questions. Tests deeper problem solving ability.

- 12-25 pages, all details will be incredibly laid out
- Scripted, rigorous
- You can't steer the case on how it flows
- McKinsey uses the time to steer you away and test the rigor of your math
- Point A to Point B is set in stone
- Deeper creative insights, more math, harder math

## Middle Ground (Bain)

Back and forth, practicing leading someone through the interview.

- Take you through a pathway that's not pre-determined order
- You can choose which piece of the case to focus on
- Choose your own adventure

## Interviewee-Led (BCG)

Most rigorous. Lead yourself.

- Should feel same as McKinsey if you're a great caser
- You're requesting data each new step

**Key Takeaway:** Be ready for McKinsey's structure and BCG's autonomy.
