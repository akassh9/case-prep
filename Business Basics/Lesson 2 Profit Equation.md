# Profit Equation

$$Profit = Revenue - Cost$$

How efficiently you're using inputs or costs to generate output or revenue. Displays efficiency.

Taking it down a level:

$$Revenue = Price \times Volume$$

High level, prices as weighted average price times sum of all of the units.

$$Costs = Fixed + Variable$$

Profit is a measure of return for shareholders. Surplus.

- **Nonprofit** distributes the surplus back into the organization.
- **Governments** either operate with a budget surplus or a deficit.

## Homework

### Mini Case Practice

A company's profits have dropped by 20%. Form a hypothesis: is it revenue decline or cost increase? Structure your investigation using the profit equation.

> We know that the profit equation is Revenue less Costs.
> Since profits went down 20% it could have been caused by a drop in revenue or a rise in costs.
>
> For **revenue** we can break it down as price times volume. This can be affected by two factors: has the company been selling less units? Or has the company been giving out higher discounts?
>
> For **costs**, which can be broken down as fixed + variable. Fixed constitutes the operating costs usually like rents and salaries. Whereas the variable is more volume driven.
>
> To make a decision I would like to see the revenue numbers from this year vs last. Then I would like to see the expenses this year vs last.

### Applied Example

Choose a real company. Identify whether their recent profit performance was more influenced by revenue shifts or cost structure changes.

> I choose to dive into Eli Lilly's financial performance. Taking a look at the 10K, we can see a revenue growth from 2023 to 2024 of ~30%. During the same period, the costs went from 10.8% of the revenue to 9.7%, remaining relatively stable. This shows that Lily's recent growth has been driven by revenue increase and not a cost reduction. Diving deeper we can see that their Mounjaro line of medicine did exceptionally well growing its own revenue by 124%.

### Efficiency Lens

Take the same company and describe how efficiently it turns inputs (resources, costs) into outputs (revenue, sales).

> We can assess the efficiency of a company using the income/profit numbers and costs. Dividing the income by the cost that went into producing said revenue gives us an accounting number called the return on asset. Which for Eli Lilly will be: 10.6 billion divided by 78.7 billion, coming out to around 14%.
