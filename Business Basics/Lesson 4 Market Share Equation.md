# Market Share Equation

$$M(x) = \frac{R(x)}{S(x)}$$

Market Share = Company Revenue / Market Size

Key insights:
- If your market share is growing, it doesn't necessarily mean your revenue is increasing
- Just because your revenue is growing and market share is reducing doesn't mean you're doing great either
- Sizing revenues can be tricky for outside companies, and also for specific divisions of the companies

## Homework

### Equation Drill

Write out the market share formula. Practice applying it using hypothetical numbers (e.g., Company A = $100M revenue, Market = $1B).

> Company A market share will be 1/10 = **10%**

### Mini Case Practice

A company's market share grew from 20% to 25%, but its revenues declined. Explain how this could happen.

> We know that the market share equation is the revenue of the company divided by the revenue of the market.
>
> If the company's market share grew from 20% to 25% and the revenues declined, the only variable that could have changed was revenue of the market, which is inversely proportional and hence declining.
>
> **Conclusion:** The market that the company is in is shrinking.

### Applied Example

Pick an industry you know (e.g., smartphones, airlines). Identify one company with rising market share and explain in 3 bullet points what factors likely drove it.

### Competitive Dynamics

Compare two competitors in the same market. Estimate how pricing and volume decisions may shift their shares.
