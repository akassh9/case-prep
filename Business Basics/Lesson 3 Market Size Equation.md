# Market Size Equation

$$S(x) = V(x) \times P(x)$$

Market Size = Market Volume × Weighted Avg Price

Markets are sized in **Revenue per year**.

## Approaches

### Bottom-Up

- Single location of a purchased item
- Frequency of that purchase
- Avg price of that purchase

### Top-Down

- Start with the population that purchases an item
- Frequency of purchase
- Avg price of that purchase

## Homework

### Framework Drill

Practice explaining both **bottom-up** and **top-down** market sizing approaches in under 2 minutes.

> **Bottom-up** approaches usually start with an objective observation of a single unit of the market that is being sized. We can tally the volume of units being purchased and find a weighted avg cost of the unit in that store. Using those numbers, we can multiply it by an appropriate factor to scale it up to the city then the region, then the state and eventually the nationwide market.
>
> **Top-down** approach starts with the population of the nation, assumes a percentage that would be the consumers of said market. Estimates the frequency of purchases within a year and then scales it up with the weighted avg price of one unit. This number is then multiplied to the population number that we think will be the consumers.

### Mini Case Practice (Bottom-Up)

Estimate the size of the U.S. bottled water market by starting with one store's sales and rolling up. State assumptions clearly.

> Bottled water is usually bought in large wholesale stores like Costco, Target, and Walmart. This is important because buying in bulk reduces the frequency of our purchases but also sizes up the avg price of one transaction.
>
> If we assume that the avg American household goes grocery shopping twice in a month. And both those visits include a bottled water bulk purchase of around $30.
>
> An average grocery store sees around 350,000 customers per month. Assuming 60% of them make that purchase we have a rough volume of:
>
> $$350{,}000 \times 0.6 \times 30 = \$6{,}300{,}000$$
>
> We have an average of 25,000 grocery stores across America, so our market size would come out to around $157.5 billion.

> [!warning] Feedback
> Two issues here:
> 1. **350,000 customers/month per store is too high** — a typical grocery store sees ~15,000-30,000 customers per month, not 350k.
> 2. **Final estimate is ~6x too high** — the actual US bottled water market is around $20-25 billion. Consider: not every grocery trip includes bottled water, and $30/trip is on the high end.
>
> A better bottom-up: ~40,000 grocery stores × 20,000 customers × 20% buy water × $15 avg = ~$2.4B/month → ~$29B/year.

### Mini Case Practice (Top-Down)

Estimate the size of the U.S. annual movie theater market by using population × frequency × ticket price.

> The population of the US is around 350 million. Movie theaters have recently been on a downward trend, losing market share to streaming services. The percentage of population that goes to the theaters can be sized to around 150 million.
>
> Among this 150 million we can further segment people as:
> - **Avid movie watchers** - around 4 movies a month
> - **Casual watchers** - around 0.33 movies a month
>
> If we consider that among the 150 million the movie watching frequency is normally distributed. Where 80% of people fall on the mean of ~2.1 movies, 10% in the 4 movies a month, and 10% in 0.33 movies a month.
>
> An average movie ticket costs around $10.
>
> Equation: 125 million × 2.1 × 12 × $10 = ~$31.25B
>
> Then we have the fringes which bring it up to around **$35 billion per year** in revenue.

> [!warning] Feedback
> The frequency assumption is off:
> - **2.1 movies/month = 25 movies/year** — the average American actually goes ~4-5 times per year (~0.4/month).
> - The actual US box office is around **$10-12 billion/year**.
>
> Better calc: 150M moviegoers × 5 visits/year × $12 ticket = **$9B/year** (closer to reality).
