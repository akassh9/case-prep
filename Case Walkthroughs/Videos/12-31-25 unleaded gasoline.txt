Okay, hi. Yeah, so our case just to recap is how many gallons of unletted gasoline,
unletted gas, automobiles consume each year in the United States. So it's about the
unletted gasoline consumption each year in the United States. For this, I think I'm
going to go with a top-down approach. We're going to break it down into five different
steps, starting off with the population of the United States, which comes out to
around 350 million currently. And then step two would be to have estimate on how much
of this population owns a automobile. This is a tricky part because most people obviously
will have a personal vehicle, but a lot of these businesses will also have these business
vehicles, which are also like a significant portion of the unletted gasoline consumption
in the US. But for now, just to segment the population further, segmenting the population.
I'm going to assume a 60% of the population owns cars. This is a pretty high number
I would significantly, I would make it significantly smaller if I was doing this for a different
country, but given that US is a very car centric society, I think the 60% number here makes sense.
So 60% of 350 comes out to six times five, five, six, eight, eight, zero, three,
two hundred and ten million. At the same time, I'm also going to go back to step one,
and where I used population, I'm going to figure out a number for businesses that might own a
vehicle. This could be restaurants that do delivery like dominoes are on like one vehicle per
business, and then there would be businesses like trucking companies, which would one fleets
of vehicles. So that would be like a much like an average of 10 vehicles per, per business.
So I would actually know scratch that I'm going to stick with my population number,
two hundred and ten million, and when I segment this population further, so my two hundred and
ten million number, I'm going to put it on a table pretty much, and I'm going to segment it
according to people, people's daily usage basically. I know the biggest number would be
daily commuters.
The second would be
I have daily commuters on there, the second would be people
teenagers maybe, people that don't need to drive every day.
Teenagers are like more like college students outside. People who don't need to drive every day,
but they do have a car for basic things like grocery shopping, getting around the city,
but usually most of the time their cars are parked and their apartment complex and their
college parking, etc, etc. And then the last one would be recreational drivers.
Would drive it over the weekends, stuff like that, just for fun.
I am going to start segmenting these, so the two hundred and ten million people,
I'm going to start segmenting these into these streaming categories. I would say the daily commuters
will be the biggest portion of the chunk. I'm going to put them at around 60% of the two hundred
and ten million number. And then for teenagers and college students, I would put them at around
maybe 30%. That seems like a reasonable enough number. And then for recreational drivers,
I would put them at like 10%. I'm going to work out the macro quick, so 10% of two hundred
and ten is one one is a one, one is a two, twenty one million,
thirty percent of two, ten is three times twenty one, two is a three, two is a six,
sixty three million. And then six percent of two hundred and ten is two and one times six,
six hundred, six hundred, six hundred, six hundred twelve, one twenty six million.
Now I need to figure out the replacement rate. It's not really a replacement rate,
but the frequency at which they refill their gasoline. And what the every volume of
that refill is pretty much for recreational drivers, I would assume they would go through
around like one meter is 20 kilometers. Around 30 gallons per,
if it's around 20 gallons per week, that'll be 20 times four, which is four and four to over,
20 times four is 80 gallons per month, 80 gallons per month.
For teenagers and college students, it would be much lower. I would say they would use
probably around five gallons per week. They'll put them at 20 gallons per month,
20 gallons per month. And then for the daily commuters, I would say they would go through
about, if they use five, 20 gallons per month. Also around the 20, 25 marks, so I put them at like
30 gallons at 30 liters, 30 times 20, 20, 200, 200, 600, they don't need that much.
I would say they also go through about 80 islands, 5-10, 3-0, 3-0, 3-0, 3-0, 3-0, 4-0,
4-0, on gas seems a little bit higher, so I would put them at 60 gallons per month, 60
gallons per month. So I'm going to redo the number for the recreational drivers. I'm going to put them
down to around 50 gallons per year. This is based on Channing, this Hanukkah checks because I am
estimating the numbers currently. Given these numbers, I would say calculating the economics of it
all. The 50 gallon per month times 12 times 21 million people will give me the gas that is used
by the recreational drivers. I'm going to work that out real quick. 12 times 21, 1-2-2-1-1-2-2-4-2-2-2-5-2-2-52 times 50.
520 or 10, 520, 526, 510, 1112, 12, 12, that's a lot. 1226, 12.6 billion seems a little
bit high. Okay, not going very well. I need to multiply number by 5 as well. So 50 gallons per month.
I'm actually going to start with the college kids. Sorry about that. So the college kids spend 20 gallons per
month, which is times 12. That gives me the yearly consumption. And then it's going to be multiplied by
their population, which is 63 million. And then times five dollars, which is the average price of a
gallon of gas, 20 times 12. It gets me to the 4, 2240 times 63 into 5, 530 or 15, 530 to 8, I want 315 million.
This will be a billion dollar number, 315 times 2040, 520, 10, 203, 206, 0, sorry, 0, 0, 2, 5,
10, sorry, 315 times 24, 0, 540, 20, 4456, 14, 12, 13, 14, 2, 5, 10, 2, 3, 2, 3, 6, 0, 0, 6, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8,
the 7.6 billion, billion. Right after done, we're going to do the daily commuters,
who are numbers going to be multiplied by 87.6 times, almost twice, two, and that's two, three,
6, 6, 7.6 times 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 0, 42, 43, 44, 45, 5, 4, 8, 6, 48, 4, 9, 520, 520, 525 billion.
And then the, to come, the recreational drivers will be using 87.6 times,
1 by 3 times 2, so 87.6 multiplied by 2, 7.6 multiplied by 2, so 12, 17, 14, 15, you know, 16, 17, 17,
25.2, and that is divided by 3, 3, 5, 15, 25, 57.1, which is around 57 billion. Adding all those
together, we have 87.6 plus 57.0 plus 525.0.6, 7, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 1, 8, 19, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
16, 169.6 billion, US dollar, which seems like a very big amount. I would say,
yeah, I think what I did wrong here for feedback purposes is that my, my population is okay.
I might have a higher percentage of cart usage than actual realistic number. I put it at 60%,
which seems a little bit high. Then I have the recreational drivers at 10%, which also seems
pretty high. I think it's around 5%, plus them going to 50 gallons per month seems unreasonable,
since they are recreational drivers. And then I have college students and teenagers,
which seems like a correct assumption at 30% of the hard driving population and 20 gallons per
month. And I have the daily commuters who pay 60 gallons per month, I don't want 20 sex, which
also seems correct. I then do the math, which should be correct, but the number that I finally
would just 669.6 billion is pretty big. I would say it has been in flu. I don't know. I think
that 60% is what got around. Additionally, I think I should definitely not take into account the
number of commercial vehicles on on ground. I'm not sure how to do that. So I'm going to have to
look at that later.
