> [!warning] Feedback
> - **Segmentation too broad**: An Italian restaurant uses way more olive oil than a fried chicken shop. Similarly, not all households are the same (cooking frequency, cuisine preferences)
> - **Numbers too optimistic**: 2 bottles/month for all households and 1 bottle every 2 days for all restaurants is high
> - **Better approach**: Segment restaurants by cuisine type (Italian/Mediterranean, American, Asian, etc.) and households by usage level (heavy/medium/light)
