# Market Sizing Drills - 2025-12-30

## Size the market for Olive oil in United States of America

**Step 1: Population/Households/Businesses**
- 150 million households
- 15 million restaurants

**Step 2: Percentage Who Own/Use**
- Households: 75% use olive oil
  - Some cultures from east/southeast Asia and Latin America don't use this oil as much, whereas Europe and Americas it's pretty popular
- Restaurants: 80% use olive oil

**Step 3: Segmentation of Those Who Own/Use**
- Households: 150M × 75% = 112.5 million households
- Restaurants: 15M × 80% = 12.5 million restaurants

**Step 4: Replacement Rate**
- **Households**: 2 bottles per month = 24 bottles per year
- **Restaurants**: 1 bottle every 2 days = 15 bottles per month = 180 bottles per year

**Step 5: Weighted Avg. Price**
- **Households**: $10 per bottle
- **Restaurants**: $5 per bottle (volume discount)
- Note: Different prices used due to significant volume differences between segments

**Answer: Market Size in Revenue/Year**
- Households: $10 × 24 × 112.5M = $27 billion USD
- Restaurants: $5 × 180 × 12.5M = $11.87B ≈ $12 billion USD
- **Total Market: $40 billion USD**

> [!warning] Feedback
> - **Segmentation too broad**: An Italian restaurant uses way more olive oil than a fried chicken shop. Similarly, not all households are the same (cooking frequency, cuisine preferences)
> - **Numbers too optimistic**: 2 bottles/month for all households and 1 bottle every 2 days for all restaurants is high
> - **Better approach**: Segment restaurants by cuisine type (Italian/Mediterranean, American, Asian, etc.) and households by usage level (heavy/medium/light)

## Size the market for Public buses in Baltimore

**Step 1: Population/Households/Businesses**
- Baltimore has a population of around 500,000

**Step 2: Percentage Who Own/Use**
- Baltimore is in Maryland. Baltimore is relatively dangerous compared to other US cities which might be a blocker for people willing to use public transportation
- But it is also a democratic city, which positively but slightly affects the number of people that use the buses
- I would conservatively estimate the number at around 30% and then segment it further later

**Step 3: Segmentation of Those Who Own/Use**
- 30% of 500,000 comes out to around 150,000 people. Which at first glance seems slightly high. Just to call it out. So I think we need to be more conservative in our segmentation
- I want to segment it into:
  - **Inner city residents**: The ones that use the bus to get around (25% of users)
  - **Outskirts work travellers**: Commuters using buses for work (70% of users)
  - **Tourists**: Even though tourists weren't a part of our 500,000 population estimate, our 30% optimistic estimate gives us room to play with and we can include tourists (5% of users)
- Wait, I need to recalculate: 30% of 500,000 = 150,000, but I wrote 75,000 earlier. Let me use 75,000 to be more conservative
  - Work travellers: 0.7 × 75,000 = 52,500
  - Inner city residents: 0.25 × 75,000 ≈ 19,000
  - Tourists: ~2,000

**Step 4: Replacement Rate**
- **Work travellers**: Take the bus 5 times per week = 20 per month = 240 per year
- **Inner city residents**: Take the bus 3 times per month = 36 per year
- **Tourists**: Take the bus 4 times per year

**Step 5: Weighted Avg. Price**
- **Inner city residents & tourists**: $5 for a day pass
- **Work commuters**: $25 per month pass

**Answer: Market Size in Revenue/Year**
- Inner city residents: $5 × 36 × 19,000 = $3.42 million ≈ $3 million per year
- Tourists: $5 × 4 × 2,000 = $40,000 per year
- Work commuters: $25 × 12 × 52,500 = $15.75 million ≈ $15.3 million per year
- **Total Market: $18.34 million ≈ $18.5 million USD**

> [!warning] Feedback
> - **Usage Rate Too High**: 30% of Baltimore residents using public buses regularly is very optimistic. US cities typically see 5-10% bus ridership
> - **Math error**: Started with 30% of 500,000 = 150,000 but then switched to 75,000 without clear explanation
> - **Pricing too low**: Bus pricing seems underestimated for realistic urban transit systems
